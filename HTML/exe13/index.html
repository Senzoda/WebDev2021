            <h1>Pfizer vaccine: why a third dose of serum might be necessary</h1>
                <p>The emergence of new variants of the coronavirus is raising many
                  concerns, particularly regarding the effectiveness of vaccines.
                  According to <span>Pfizer and BioNTech</span> laboratories, their vaccine is 95%
                  effective against the classic strain of the virus. But a study by
                  the Institut Pasteur found that this serum protects 80% of the
                  British variant and 60% of the South African variant. Currently, two
                  doses of the <span>Pfizer / BioNTech</span> vaccine can provide immunity to
                  patients.</p>

            <img class="imageMini" src="../img/neymar.jpg"/>
            <p>Even though he earns around 37 million a year, Neymar still forgets where he comes from. While the “Instituto Projeto Neymar”, which he created to provide a better life for 3,000 underprivileged children in a Brazilian slum where he grew up, has been closed for 13 months due to the coronavirus, the PSG star continues to pay the salaries of the 142 employees who work there.
              "Jobs, wages and insurance are still standing, however long this crisis lasts," Neymar’s father said. All salaries represent a total of 90,000 euros per month, paid for more than a year by the Brazilian, who more than likely makes his employees happy in these difficult times. </p>

            <h3>Archegos collapse costs Morgan Stanley $911m</h3>
            <img class="imageMini" src="../img/Archegos.jpg"/>
            <p>Hedge funds make money buying and selling shares. It is thought that Archegos made some large investments in certain companies that started to go wrong.

              Its backers then insisted it raise money in a hurry, in what is known as a margin call, prompting some unusually large share sales.
              
              A margin call is when a bank asks a client to put up more funds if a trade partly funded with borrowed money has dropped steeply.
              
              If they can't afford to do that, the lender will sell the shares to try to recover what it is owed to the bank.
              
              By the end of March, Archegos owed Morgan Stanley $644m, while the investment bank lost another $267m by selling out of shares linked to...

            <h3>Leon: Billionaire Issa brothers buy fast food chain</h3>
            <img class="imageMini" src="../img/leon.jpg"/>
            <p>More than 70 Leon restaurants across the UK and Europe have been sold to the brothers' giant petrol forecourt business EG Group.

              In a joint statement, Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa said the firm was a "fantastic brand we have long admired".
              
              Leon boss John Vincent, who co-founded the firm in 2004, said: "In some ways this is a sad day for me."
              
              "We have tried hard, done some good things, made a healthy amount of mistakes, and built a business that quite a few people are kind enough to say that they love," he added.
              
              The deal includes 42 company-owned restaurants, as well as 29 franchise sites which are mainly found in airports and train stations across the UK and...</p>
